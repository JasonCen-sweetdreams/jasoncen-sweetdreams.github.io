### **Commercial Information Intelligent Retrieval Platform Based on Knowledge Graphs**  
**March 2021 – January 2022**  
- Developed and deployed web crawlers to achieve large-scale collection and incremental updates of the required corpora (including news data) for the project.
- Participated in designing the knowledge graph, utilizing the BERT model to identify and process entities and relationships within queries.
- Successfully reproduced and built a knowledge graph-based Q&A model, completed model training and inference tasks, and seamlessly integrated the model services with the backend system.
- Project Achievement: Awarded Third Prize in the Finals of the 15th “Win at CUHK Technology Park Cup” Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.

### **Research on the Integration of Text and Graphs **
**March 2024 – Present**
- Explored the application of large models in text-attributed graphs, investigating their enhancement effects on node and edge attributes, and contributed multiple text-attributed graph datasets to the CS-TAG Benchmark (github.com/sktsherlock/TAG-Benchmark).
- Analyzed the impact of newly added textual attributes processed by large models on the performance of dynamic graph models, evaluating their practical utility.
- Currently researching the collaborative effects of multi-agent systems in simulated graph generation tasks, with a focus on the potential applications of large models in this domain.
